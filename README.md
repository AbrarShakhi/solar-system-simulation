# Solar System Simulation with Pygame

This Python application simulates our solar system using the Pygame library. It includes the following celestial bodies:

1. **Sun**
2. **Earth**
3. **Mars**
4. **Venus**
5. **Mercury**

You can add more planets, moons, and satellites. Additionally, you can customize their initial velocity, mass, and distance to create your own interactive solar system model.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different parameters! 🌏🪐☀️
